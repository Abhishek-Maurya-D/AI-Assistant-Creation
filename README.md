# 🤖 AI Assistant Creation

This project aims to develop an **AI-powered assistant** that can help users with various tasks, including:

- Answering questions  
- Generating content  
- Providing programming support  
- Natural language understanding  
- Context-aware responses  
- Code explanation and assistance

## Deployment

You can try the live app here: [AI Assistant Creation](https://abhishek-maurya-d.github.io/AI-Assistant-Creation/)

## 🧠 Overview

This AI Assistant project combines:

- **HTML** for the interface  
- **CSS** for styling  
- **JavaScript** for frontend logic  

The assistant processes user text input and provides intelligent responses by integrating with a backend model or an external API that powers the AI responses (this could be a hosted AI model or service).

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **User Input**  
   The user types a question or a request into an input field on the webpage.

2. **Processing Input**  
   JavaScript captures this input and sends it either to a backend service or directly to an AI model API for interpretation.

3. **AI Response**  
   The AI processes the text and sends a response back.

4. **Display**  
   The webpage updates in real-time to show the response in a user-friendly format.

This setup enables natural language interactions just like popular AI assistants.
